Some notes on what I've been meaning to get around to

## Production

- Output is evenly split between surrounding blocks that can accept it
- Buildings can output directly into other buildings

## Unloader

- In v7, unloaders were made a little slower, but smarter, and can be used to equalize resources between adjacent buildings.

## Overdrive projector

- Boosting power sources is free\* electricity.
- Affects conveyors, but this mostly helps only when the whole conveyor is under effect.

## Mass Driver

- Can unload directly to buildings or core.
- Best not to make it rotate back and forth.

Thanks for reading!
